# TrianglePuzzle
This project solves a puzzle that involves placing 12 different shaped pieces onto a tringular board. 

The puzzle is solved in java using a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solutions to a tabletop puzzle. 

Description of the general puzzle found here: https://github.com/corinaminer/triangle-puzzle. The description is given by a close friend of mine who first introduced me to the puzzle. Thank you Corina!
